# Lokasenna_GUI
Lua GUI library for [REAPER][1] scripts

## Obligatory Preamble
As powerful as REAPER's scripting capabilities are, it offers nothing in the way of
providing a graphical interface for the end-user to make choices, tinker with settings, etc.
Many scripters opt to designate certain lines in the script with _USER_ _SETTINGS_
_HERE_ and _EDIT_ _THIS_ _LINE_, but - in my opinion - any feature that requires users to edit
Lua, EEL, or (_*shudder*_) Python files directly is woefully incomplete. Rude, even.
  
In the process of learning to write scripts for myself I found myself copying, pasting, and
extending the same fragments of code, cobbled together from a handful of forum threads
with examples of REAPER's graphical functions, and eventually decided to just stop what I
was doing and put it all together into a proper GUI toolkit.

Enjoy. :)

Or don't. See if I care.

## Usage
See [Getting Started][4] in the project wiki.

## Discussion
Questions, comments, feature requests, bug reports, and the latest celebrity gossip should be 
directed to the project's [official thread][3] on the REAPER forum.

## Further Detail
I'll try to keep [the project Wiki][2] up to date, but ultimately the most detailed and accurate
source of documentation will always be comments in the _Example_ scripts and libraries/classes.
